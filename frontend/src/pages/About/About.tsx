              <p>
                I've been weightlifting about 4 years now and absolutely love
                it. Recently, I've gotten really into triathlons - there's
                something amazing about pushing your limits across different
                disciplines. My next big goal? Training for an Ironman. It's a
                huge challenge, but that's what makes it exciting!

              <p>
                Give me a tough mountain trail and a beautiful sunrise, and I'm
                in my happy place. I love traveling to mountainous regions and
                finding challenging hikes. There's nothing quite like reaching
                the summit as the sun comes up - it's the perfect reward for an
                early morning start!

                I'm a bit of a data nerd when it comes to fitness tracking. I
                use everything from an Apollo Neuro to an Oura Ring and Apple
                Watch to track my biometrics. I'm collecting all this data with
                the hope of doing some cool AI projects with it someday. Who
                knows what patterns I might find?
